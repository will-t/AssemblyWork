## README

When you are ready to begin testing, you will need to rename the following 
files to use the .java extension instead of .txt :

```
$projectdir/test/java/edu/tntech/csc2310/fa2021/CourseTest.txt
$projectdir/test/java/edu/tntech/csc2310/fa2021/CourseCatalogTest.txt
```

See the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://stationinthemetro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Markdown_Cheat_Sheet_v1-1.pdf) for 
information on how to format this file.

You must document the following:
* How to compile the program
* How to run the program
* The structure of the directories in the source
