-------------------------------------------------
These are two programs with very simple algorithms designed to show you the speed efficency of certain different algorithms
When running both these programs you can see how many iterations each algorithm must go though in order to calculate the GCD with Euclids being less 
than that of the Factoring program. If you would like to see a different example alter the two numbers in the file to be larger and see a better example.

Two run.bat files are included to compile and run these programs
